## Bookmarklets

To use a bookmarklet:
- copy the whole contents of the file to your clipboard
- In your web browser create a new bookmark
- In place of the bookmark URL, paste the code you have copied to your clipboard.

If you follow the above instructions, then whenever you click the bookmark the code will be executed against the page you have open.

### printableroster.js

Use this bookmarklet on the volunteer roster page of webfms. It will open up a new tab in your browser with the roles and assigned volunteers listed in a table. It will rename the 'Other' role to 'Faulty Barcodes', because that's what we use the 'Other' role for here at Hove Park Juniors, and it will number the Marshal roles (in descending order,because again that's most useful for us).
